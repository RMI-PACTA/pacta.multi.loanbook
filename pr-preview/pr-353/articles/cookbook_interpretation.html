<p>Running the analysis will produce a number of outputs that can be
used to gain insights into the alignment of financial institutions with
climate transition scenarios and to approximate transition risk. The two
main pieces of the analysis are the PACTA for Banks analysis and the net
aggregate alignment metric. The PACTA for Banks analysis will provide
insights into the alignment of the financial institution with the
climate transition scenarios for each of the sectors covered by PACTA.
The net aggregate alignment metric is intended be used as a high level
overview alignment metric for the financial sector. The analyses thus
complement each other where the net aggregate alignment metric can serve
as a starting point to identify sectors or groups of financial
institutions that seem to require particular attention. The PACTA for
Banks analysis can then be used to drill down into the details of the
alignment of the financial institution with the climate transition
scenarios.</p>
<p>The following sections will provide an overview of results that are
generated using this analysis and how to interpret them. It will briefly
explain each of the relevant metrics, it will mention the plots that
correspond to the metrics, and it will explain how the output data sets
map to the values shown in the plots. The same will be provided for the
coverage statistics that are generated for the analysis.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="coverage-diagnostics">Coverage Diagnostics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#coverage-diagnostics"></a>
</h3>
<p>The coverage diagnostics include both a comparison of the number and
value of matched loan books with the raw loan books and a comparison of
the production capacity of companies in the matched loan books with the
production capacity of companies in the wider economy. The coverage
diagnostics are intended to provide insights into the quality of the
matching process and the coverage of the loan books in the analysis.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="match-success-rate">Match Success Rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#match-success-rate"></a>

<p>The match success rate is calculated per sector and can be calculated
based on either of the number of loans, the outstanding value of the
loans, or the credit limit of the loans. In either case, the sum value
of the matched loans is compared with that of the raw loan books.</p>
<p>The output data set contains all three versions of the metric and can
be found in the
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics/lbk_match_success_rate&lt;...&gt;.csv</code>
file, where &lt;…&gt; will be replaced with the name of the variable set

<h5 id="interpretation-of-the-match-success-rate">Interpretation of the Match Success Rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpretation-of-the-match-success-rate"></a>
</h5>
<p>The match success rate is a coverage metric of properly identified
loans relative to the raw input loan books. It is always provided by
sector, because a company in the loan book can only be expected to be
matched to the ABCD if it operates in the same sector. Since PACTA only
covers a subset of economic sectors, judging the success of the matching
process should only take into account the loans that fall within the
scope of the PACTA analysis. Of course, the extent of exposure to these
sectors may vary significantly between input loan books. But this has
more to do with the strategy of the bank than with the quality of the
matching process.</p>
<p>Generally, it is desirable to reach as high a match success rate as
possible for each sector. It was mentioned before that the time spent to
maximize the match success rate is at the discretion of the user.
However, it is recommended to aim for a match success rate of more than
80% of the loan value within each sector that you are interested in. The
steps to achieve this are described in the <a href="https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/cookbook_running_the_analysis.html#matching-process">section
on the matching process</a>.</p>
<p>If after following and concluding the matching procedure the match
success rate is high for a given sector or the entire loan book, this
indicates that you can draw conclusions from the PACTA analysis for the
loan books with higher confidence. If it remains low for some sectors,
this can point to one of several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be data quality issues in the raw loan book. For example,
the company names may have been entered wrongly, or the sector
classification may be incorrect. Problems with the sector classification
may be corrected to some degree through desk research. However, there
are limits to inferring sector codes like that and it is a time
consuming process.</li>
<li>There may be coverage issues in the ABCD. It is possible that all
entries in the raw loan book are correct and the match success rate
remains low, because the companies the loan book is exposed to are not
covered in the ABCD. Since the ABCD is an externally sourced data set,
there are two main approaches to tackling this. One is to reach out to
the data provider and try to understand/add the missing data points. The
other is to try and add the relevant data points manually based on your
own data or research. This is a very involved process and not standard
procedure and will therefore not be covered in this cookbook. Beyond
those options, it is recommended to highlight coverage issues, if they
cannot be fixed.</li>

files, please refer to the <a href="https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/data_dictionary.html#match-success-rate">relevant

<p>The variables in the table map to the figures as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>&lt;by_group&gt;:</code> The variable that the loan books are
split by. This determines the number of panes in the plot. E.g. in
figures 2 and 3, the loan books are split by bank type, generating one
pane per type. In figures 4 and 5, the loan books are not split by any
variable, generating a single pane for the entire set of loan
books.</li>
<li>
<code>sector</code>: The match success rate is analysed by sector,
with the sectors shown in separate columns. This is because a loan in
the raw loan book can only be matched to the ABCD if the company
operates in the sector covered by the ABCD. This highlights the
importance of good data quality in the sector classification of the raw
loan book. The target should be to have a sufficiently high match
success rate for any sector that you want to make robust statements
about.</li>
<li>
<code>match_n</code>: When showing the absolute number of loans
matched (figure 3), this determines the size of the matched part of each
column.</li>
<li>
<code>total_n</code>: When showing the absolute number of loans
matched (figure 3), this determines the total size (matched + unmatched)
of each column.</li>
<li>
<code>match_success_rate_rel</code>: When showing the relative
number of loans matched (figure 2), this determines the size of the
matched part of each column.</li>
<li>
<code>match_outstanding</code>: When showing the absolute matched
value of loans outstanding (figure 5), this determines the size of the
matched part of each column.</li>
<li>
<code>total_outstanding</code>: When showing the absolute matched
value of loans outstanding (figure 5), this determines the total size
(matched + unmatched) of each column.</li>
<li>
<code>match_success_outstanding_rel</code>: When showing the
relative matched value of loans outstanding (figure 4), this determines
the size of the matched part of each column.</li>
<li>
<code>match_credit_limit</code>: When showing the absolute matched
credit limit of loans (not shown in figure), this determines the size of
the matched part of each column.</li>
<li>
<code>total_credit_limit</code>: When showing the absolute matched

<h4 id="loan-book-production-coverage">Loan Book Production Coverage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loan-book-production-coverage"></a>
</h4>
<p>The loan book production coverage is calculated per sector and region
(for all regions available in the given <code>scenario_source</code>).
For a given combination of sector and region, it provides the total
number of companies with operations in the sector and region in the
wider economy. It then provides the number of matched companies in the
loan book with operations in that sector and region. A ratio of the two
values tells you the share of companies in the sector and region that
you have identified in the matched loan book. Similarly, the data set
provides the total production capacity of a sector in a region in the
wider economy and the production by companies in the matched loan book
in that sector and region. Notice that it only matters THAT the company
was matched in the loan book, NOT how large the granted loan is. The
ratio of the two values then tells us what percentage of the production
capacity of a sector in a region the financial institution is involved
in. Again, being involved in that production capacity is decidedly not a
full responsibility, because many matched companies will likely have
additional sources of funding. Lastly, the output provides the sum of
the loan size outstanding to the matched companies in each of the
sectors and regions.</p>
<p>The output data set can be found in the
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics/summary_statistics_loanbook_coverage&lt;...&gt;.csv</code>
file, where &lt;…&gt; will be replaced with the name of the variable set

<h5 id="interpretation-of-the-loan-book-production-coverage">Interpretation of the Loan Book Production Coverage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpretation-of-the-loan-book-production-coverage"></a>
</h5>
<p>The loan book production coverage is a coverage metric of the
production capacity of companies in the loan book relative to the
production capacity of companies in the wider economy. It is always
provided by sector and region. Comparisons across sectors need to be
separate, because of differing output units. And the coverage by region
allows highlighting the regional focus of a bank for the given sector.
The production coverage compares matched companies only, hence it
depends on the quality of the matching process and any statements about
the share of economic activity covered by the matched loan book should
take this relationship into account.</p>
<p>Assuming a solid match success rate, the loan book production
coverage tells you if the loan book is exposed to a large share of
production capacity within a certain sector and region. This information
can be relevant when assessing the impact of regional economic trends
and policies that may affect the sector. For example, the loan book more
susceptible to transition risk in one region than in another even when
the introduced policies are very similar, because companies financed may
operate a larger share of the production capacity in the first
region.</p>

<h4 id="technology-mix">Technology Mix<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#technology-mix"></a>

<p>The technology mix metric compares the technology mix of the
production capacity of companies in the loan book with that of the
production capacity of companies in the wider economy and the scenario
technology mix five years into the future. The output data set can be
found in the
<code>../analysis/standard/&lt;...&gt;/data_tech_mix_&lt;sector&gt;.csv</code>

means that the technology mix results always only show results for one
group at a time.</p>
<p>The technology mix can only be calculated for sectors that have
technology level scenario pathways. Generally, those tend to be sectors
for which scalable low carbon alternatives exist. The technology mix can
also be calculated for sectors in which all technologies are projected
to phase down or out, but the results are less meaningful in those
cases, as the technology mix cannot show the absolute requirements for a
phasedown.</p>

</h5>
<p>This plot shows the technology mix for the automotive sector of a
loan book. We can see that the exposure to automotive production of
different engine types in the loan book shifts from 2022 to 2027. The
exposure to electric vehicle production increases, while the exposure to
internal combustion engine production decreases. A similar shift can be
observed in the wider economy, although the shift starts from a smaller
share in 2022, which implies the companies that are being financed have
a relatively strong focus on electric vehicle production compared to the
overall economy. We can also see what the technology mix looks like for
the scenario in 2027. In this case, the shift of automotive production
from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles in the portfolio
exposure is not as strong as it ought to be to be in line with the

<p>In another example of the technology mix plot for the power sector,
we can again see a loan book that is exposed to a much higher share of
low carbon technologies than the wider economy, mainly due to the large
exposure to companies operating renewable energy power. The plot shows
only a marginal shift for the loan book between 2022 and 2027, which
means that the share of technologies does not quite align with the
scenario values in 2027. However, we can again see that the loan book as
far ahead of the wider economy in terms of low carbon technology
exposure in the power sector, with nuclear power being the only notable
exception of smaller exposure in the loan book.</p>

</h5>
<p>The technology mix plots show the exposure to underlying technologies
by sector, where the technology mix of the financed companies is
combined using the portfolio weight of each loan to generate the
aggregate technology mix at the loan book level. This means that a
technology mix at the company level reflects the underlying production
of the company in terms of real economic output units, whereas the
technology mix at the loan book level reflects the financial exposure of
the bank to these technologies through its lending activities. As such,
the overall size of the production activities of the underlying
companies does not impact the technology mix of the loan book. It is a
weighted average of relative production numbers. The technology mix at
the loan book level therefore works better as a risk indicator than as a
measure of impact.</p>
<p>For the corporate economy bars, the technology mix is based on the
unweighted sum of underlying physical production capacity and for the
scenario bar, the technology mix is based on the initial technology mix
of the portfolio, extrapolated with required changes based on the market
share approach that assumes all companies maintain their overall
production shares in the sector.</p>

</h5>
<p>The production volume trajectory plots show the exposure of the loan
book to production capacity trends of the financed companies for a given
technology over the next five years, showing changes in percent relative
to the start year. It contrasts this trend with the production trend of
the real economy and with the trajectories that the loan book would have
to finance in order to be aligned with scenarios based on the market
share approach. The shading of the graph represents the direction of the
required changes based on the scenario. If the green area is at the top
of the graph, the technology needs to increase over time to align with
the scenario. If the red area is at the top of the graph, the technology
needs to decrease over time to align with the scenario. The required
rates of change that apply for the individual loan book are determined
using the market share approach, using the target market share ratio
(TMSR) for high-carbon technologies and the sector market share
percentage (SMSP) for low-carbon technologies. If the projected
production trend of the loan book is equal or greater than the highest
scenario line for an increasing technology, the loan book is aligned
with the most ambitious scenario for that technology.</p>
<p>If it is below that scenario line, the loan book is misalgined with
the most ambitious scenario for that technology. It may still be aligned
with a less ambitious scenario. Likewise, if the projected production
trend of the loan book is equal or lower than the lowest scenario line
for a decreasing technology, the loan book is aligned with the most
ambitious scenario for that technology. If it is above that scenario
line, the loan book is misaligned with the most ambitious scenario for
that technology. It may still be aligned with a less ambitious
scenario.</p>
<p>For more information on how to calculate the TMSR and the SMSP, see
the <a href="https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.analysis/articles/target-market-share.html" class="external-link">PACTA
for Banks documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Also notice that alignment for one technology of a sector does not
imply alignment of the entire sector. For example, building out electric
vehicle production capacity in line with the IEA NZE by 2050 scenario
does not say anything about the alignment of internal combustion engine
production capacity. If ICE production does not decrease sufficiently
fast, the sector as a whole will not be aligned. This would show both in
the technology mix chart, where the slow decrease in ICE production
would depress the share of EV production and in the production volume
trajectory for the ICE production capacity.</p>

<p>The emission intensity metric compares the future emission intensity
per real economic output unit in a given sector of the companies in the
loan book with that of the companies in the wider economy and the
scenario trajectories for the loan book five years into the future,
based on the SDA approach. The output data set can be found in the

groups in the variable set in the <code>by_group</code> parameter. This
means that the emission intensity results always only show results for
one group at a time.</p>
<p>The emission intensity metric can be calculated for any sector that
has sector level physical emission intensity pathways, defined as
absolute emissions divided by absolute real economic output. This is
usually available for a broader range of sectors than technology level
pathways, including for the so called hard-to-abate sectors, where low
carbon alternatives to the most commonly used production technologies
are often not available yet, or at least not market ready.</p>
<p>As the emission intensity metric is compared to scenario values based
on the SDA approach, the calculation of the scenario values for each
portfolio follows different rules than the market share approach used in
the technology mix and the production volume trajectory. The SDA
approach is a convergence approach and does not necessarily require
stable market share for all companies and/or loan books. Rather, it
requires that all participants in a sector approach the same emission
intensity target at the end year of the scenario. Notice that the end
year of the scenario is usually much farther in the future than the five
year forward looking horizon of the analysis, which is why the loan book
value is not expected to have converged with the scenario value after
five years.</p>

<p>This example of the emission intensity pathway plot for cement
production shows that the emission intensity of the companies the loan
book is exposed to remain relatively stable at a higher level than that
of the wider economy over the next five years. It also shows that both
the target for the loan book based on the IEA NZE by 2050 scenario and
the adjusted target for the wider economy based on the same scenario
decrease over that time frame. The specific pathways of both these
scenario trajectories converge in the end year of the scenario
calculation - in this case 2050 - because they were calculated using a
convergence approach, the SDA approach.</p>

its steel company exposure that is below the emission intensity of the

companies in the loan book as well as the wider economy is rather stable
and both would need to decrease over the next five years in order to be

</h5>
<p>The emission intensity pathway plots show the physical emission
intensity trajectory of the portfolio weighted companies that the loan
book is exposed to and contrast this with the physical emission
intensity pathway of all companies in the relevant region of the real
economy. Physical emission intensity in this case refers to the amount
of CO2(eq) emissions per unit of real economic output from the sector at
hand. Since the units of output are interchangeable per sector, but not
across sectors, the physical emission intensity is a useful sector level
metric. Since the emission intensity metric does not require technology
level production pathways to be available, it can be used for sectors
that do now have market-ready low carbon alternatives to replace
high-carbon technologies yet. For the PACTA sectors, this is the case
for the hard-to-abate sectors, such as cement, steel, and aviation. It
can be applied to all other PACTA sectors as well though, although it
may not be equally meaningful in all cases (for example, for a phaseout
of coal mining, the emission intensity of coal mining may not be the
most actionable metric).</p>
<p>The emission intensity of different loan books will vary within the
same sector, depending on the companies that the loan books are exposed
to. Accordingly, the effort required by each of the banks to align their
loan books with the target scenario in that sector will differ as well.
With the SDA approach being a convergence approach, any loan book with a
higher than average emission intensity will be expected to follow a
steeper decline in emission intensity than a loan book with a lower than
average emission intensity. This is a necessary requirement of the
convergence approach to scenario allocation. However, the initial level
of the physical emission intensity of the loan book does not impact the
alignment of the loan book. Whether or not alignment is achieved,
depends solely on the rate of change of the emission intensity relative
to the loan book specific decarbonization pathway.</p>

<p>This section provides a description of the data outputs and graphs
related to the Net Aggregate Alignment Metrics. Some of the data outputs
are intermediate files that do not directly map to a plot. Such outputs
are explained in detail in the <code><a href="../articles/data_dictionary.html">vignette("data_dictionary")</a></code>.
The plots are discussed in more detail, including the relevant table
from the data dictionary and how the variables map to the plots.</p>
<p>Please note that all plots in this section build on the Net Aggregate
Alignment Metric, which is an aggregation of PACTA results for every
sector that allows for a high level overview of sector alignment at the
loan book level or higher. An intended use case is to use this metric
first at the aggregate financial system level across all loan books and
then drill down along different dimensions of interest. The idea behind
this approach is to facilitate the comparison of many different banks
and loan books using forward-looking production based alignment metrics
without producing an excessive amount of plots and results that becomes
hard to navigate and that may not reveal higher level patterns easily.
The Net Aggregate Alignment Metric was first developed in the ECB
Banking Supervision paper <a href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/ecb/pub/pdf/ssm.bankingsectoralignmentreport202401~49c6513e71.sl.pdf" class="external-link">“Risks
from misalignment of banks’ financing with the EU climate objectives -
Assessment of the alignment of the European banking sector”</a>. For a
detailed description of the methodology used in this implementation of
the Net Aggregate Alignment Metric, see the two-part documentation of
the metric, focusing on the starting with the <a href="https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/company_alignment_metric.html">company
level calculation of the net alignment metric</a> and proceeding with
the approach to <a href="https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/loanbook_aggregated_alignment_metric.html">aggregating

<p>The net aggregate alignment sankey plot summarizes the financial
exposure of a (grouped or ungrouped) loan book (left node) by financial
exposure to PACTA sectors (middle node) and finally by whether or not
the exposures are aligned based on the net aggregate alignment metric
(right node). Alignment is defined as a binary variable, where any
underlying exposure with an alignment metric greater or equal to 0 is
considered aligned and any exposure with an alignment metric less than 0
is considered misaligned. The main purpose of this type of visualization
is to provide an overview of system level alignment at one quick glance,
at the expense of some detail that can be obtained from other plots. The
output data set can be found in the

</h5>
<p>This example of the sankey plot looks at the aggregate financial
exposure of all analyzed loan books (figure 12, left node). The middle
node shows that a large share of the financial exposure can be found the
in the power sector, with the automotive and oil &amp; gas sectors also
contributing significant chunks. Cement, coal and steel contribute minor
parts to the overall financial exposure. The right node, in turn, shows
how the sector exposure is distributed with regard to a binary alignment
metric, based on the net aggregate alignment metric. Overall, green
ribbons indicate the size of the aligned exposure, while red ribbons
indicate the size of the misaligned exposure. We can see that aligned
exposures make up a much smaller share of the overall exposure than
misaligned exposures. The distribution of alignment/misalignment
furthermore varies significantly between sectors, with half the exposure
value in the oil &amp; gas sector aligned, a much higher share than in
any other of the sectors. The nature of this plot as a high level
overview means that it does not show all the details. For example, the
underlying companies are classified as aligned or misaligned in a binary
manner. The net aggregate alignment metric is a continuous variable
though, so the binary representation may skew the extent of alignment to
some degree and should always be complemented with additional analyses
from the following plots.</p>

<h5 id="interpretation-of-the-sankey-plot">Interpretation of the Sankey Plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpretation-of-the-sankey-plot"></a>
</h5>
<p>The sankey plot emphasizes the distribution of the financial exposure
of the analyzed loan books across sectors and aligned or misaligned
counterparties. The plot necessitate categorical variables for the types
of nodes, which means that the net aggregate alignment metric is
transformed into a binary variable. The size of each group in a node
along the y axis is the financial exposure to that group and that is the
only continuous variable in this plot. In effect, the statements you can
make based on this plot are along the lines of “XY USD of the financial
exposure of the loan books is concentrated in the power sector. Among
the exposure to power companies, the largest share goes to companies
that are misaligned with the selected scenario”. As we can see, this
reveals more about how much money is lent to how many companies that are
misaligned in some form. It says nothing about how misaligned these
companies are. They might all be very close to, but just behind, the
scenario target. Or they might all be grossly off target. The reason why
this is still a useful plot is because you get a very quick over view,
in which sectors are the largest shares of your misaligned companies.
This makes it easier to prioritize which company analytics to look at
first. Additionally, you can validate the severity of the misalignment
in a given sector, by inspecting the alignment-by-exposure plots, which
will be explained next.</p>

<p>The variables in the table map to the figures as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>&lt;by_group&gt;</code>: The variable that the loan books are
split by. This corresponds to the leftmost node in the sankey plot and
the values can either be all the same for the aggregate view on all
analysed loan books or the values corresponding to each of the
groups.</li>
<li>
<code>middle_node</code>: The PACTA sectors for which there is some
financial exposure in the analyzed loan books.</li>
<li>
<code>is_aligned</code>: Binary variable that can have values
“aligned” or “not aligned”. All exposures that are aligned are
represented as green ribbons, all those that are not aligned are red
ribbons. The underlying net alignment metric refers to the five year
forward-looking values in the final year of the analysis.</li>
<li>
<code>loan_size_outstanding</code>: The financial exposure of the
loan books to the individual sectors and grouped by
<code>ìs_aligned</code>. This is the continuous variable that determines
the size of the ribbons in the plot along the y-axis.</li>

<h4 id="net-aggregate-alignment-by-financial-exposure">Net Aggregate Alignment by Financial Exposure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#net-aggregate-alignment-by-financial-exposure"></a>
</h4>
<p>The net aggregate alignment by financial exposure plot summarizes the
net aggregate alignment metric (y-axis) of a (grouped or ungrouped) loan
book (dot color) by financial exposure to PACTA sectors (x-axis). Every
sector is shown in a separate pane with equal scales, which allows
comparing the significance of exposures across sectors. In this plot,
the net aggregate alignment metric is presented as a continuous variable
along the y axis, which allows for more nuance compared with the sankey
plot. Exposures to very misaligned companies will influence the loan
book level alignment more negatively here, because the loan book level
net aggregate alignment metric is a weighted mean of the underlying
continuous company level net aggregate alignments weighted by the
financial exposure. However, this additional detail makes the plot
slightly slower to read than the sankey plot. Generally, this plot
emphasizes the scale of the net aggregate alignment more than the
exposure and is therefore a good complementary plot to the sankey plot.
The output data set can be found in the
<code>../analysis/aggregated/data_scatter_alignment_exposure&lt;...&gt;.csv</code>
file, where &lt;…&gt; will be replaced with the names of each of the
groups in the variable set in the <code>by_group</code> parameter.</p>

<h5 id="example-plots-alignment-by-exposure">Example Plots Alignment by Exposure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-plots-alignment-by-exposure"></a>
</h5>
<p>In this example plot, we analyse the net aggregate alignment by
different bank types across six of the PACTA sectors. We can see that
the exposures of credit unions in the oil &amp; gas sector (misaligned)
and in the power sector (aligned), as well as the exposures of less
significant institutions in the coal sector (misaligned) have very
pronounced net aggregate alignment metrics. This can be a further avenue
for research into which specific companies seem to drive these results.
It is also evident, that this plot does not make it very easy to compare
the financial exposures across sectors, which highlights again one of
the strengths of the sankey plot. Within sector however, financial
exposure between groups can easily be differentiated.</p>

</h5>
<p>Generally, the alignment by exposure sector is very useful for
interpretations of net alignment within sectors. Groups (e.g. bank
types, but possibly other types of groups) further to the right of the
x-axis have a larger financial exposure to companies in this sector than
other groups. Dots higher on the y-axis indicate groups for which the
loan book level net aggregate alignment is further ahead of the scenario
than for groups with a dot lower on the y-axis. The 0 intercept on the
y-axis means the weighted average net aggregate alignment of the group
is right on target.</p>
<p>Of course, since the net aggregate alignment at loan book level is a
weighted average of the underlying company level net aggregate
alignments, a positive y-value does not mean that there are no
misaligned companies to be found in the loan book for this sector. If
individual company level alignment is of concern for your use case, you
will have to check company level results to validate that. The most
comprehensive output data set to inspect company level net alignment
metrics is the
<code>../analysis/aggregated/company_exposure_net_aggregate_alignment&lt;...&gt;.csv</code>
file. Documentation for its contents can be found in <a href="https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/data_dictionary.html#company-net-aggregate-alignment-metric-with-financial-exposures">the

</h4>
<p>The net aggregate alignment metric can be disaggregated into build
out and phase out components for some sectors. Specifically those
sectors, that have technology level pathways and both high carbon and
low carbon technologies, can be disaggregated in this way. It may be
insightful to analyze these components to understand better if any
deviations from the scenario value are driven by too much or too little
effort on either of the two sides. For example, in the automotive
sector, this may reveal that almost all of the misalignment is due to a
lack of phasing out high carbon technologies, while low carbon ones may
be aligned in their build out. Similar patterns could be detected in the
power sector. Such patterns can be understood as a prompt, which of the
standard PACTA analyses may be most relevant to inspect for further
drill down. The output data set is available both at the loan book level
to compare the disaggregation by groups and at the company level to
identify individual companies with strong drivers. The loan book level
files can be found in the
<code>../analysis/aggregated/data_scatter_sector&lt;...&gt;.csv</code>
file, where &lt;…&gt; will be replaced with the names of each of the
groups in the variable set in the <code>by_group</code> parameter. The

</h5>
<p>This example plot shows the loan book level build out and phaseout
disaggregation for three bank types. The y-axis shows that all three
bank types have loan books with exposures to misalgined companies in
terms of phaseout technologies. This means that high carbon technology
production capacity is not decreasing fast enough in the loan books to
align with the selected scenario. The build out side (x-axis) of the
plot is more varied, with two of the bank types being aligned in terms
of exposure to build out technologies and one being misaligned. The
color of the dots indicates net alignment (the sum of the build out and
phase out values). Only one of the three bank types has a positive net
aggregate alignment value, which is indicated by the green hue and its
position above the diagonal line. This is a case where the alignment in
build out technologies outweighs the misalignment in phase out
technologies.</p>

<p>For a deeper dive into the company level disaggregation of the build
out and phase out components, the following plot shows the same
disaggregation for less significant financial institutions at the
company level. The less significant institutions are the most misaligned
dot in the previous loan book level chart. The plot shows that most of
the companies the less significant institutions are exposed to in the
automotive sector are firmly in the area of both misaligned build out
and phase out technologies with only a few company exposures being
closer to any positive alignment components. This means that the
misalignment of the automotive sector for less significant financial
institutions does not appear to be driven by few outliers, but seems to
be rather consistent across exposures.</p>

</h5>
<p>The buildout-phaseout scatter plots show the disaggregation of the
net aggregate alignment metric into build out and phase out components.
The x-axis shows the alignment of the loan book with the build out
technologies of the sector, while the y-axis shows the alignment with
the phase out technologies of the sector. The diagonal line from the top
left to the bottom right of the plot indicates the threshold above which
the sum of the build out and phase out components correspond to a
positive net aggregate alignment value. The color of the dots indicates
the net aggregate alignment of the loan book. Green dots indicate a
positive net aggregate alignment, while red dots indicate a negative net
aggregate alignment. The plot is also available at company level. If
generated for loan books, one dot corresponds to one group of loan
books, e.g. if there are three bank types, the aggregate loan books by
bank types will be represented by three dots. It generated for
companies, one dot corresponds to one company, where only companies are
shown that have any exposure for the given <code>by_group</code>,
e.g. if results are generated for <code>by_group = "bank_type"</code>
and there are three bank types, then we will get three company level
plots, each one containing only dots for companies that the
corresponding bank type has an exposure to. The plot can be used to
identify which of the two components of the net aggregate alignment
metric is driving the alignment or misalignment of the loan book.</p>
