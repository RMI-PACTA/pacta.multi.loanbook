<p>This section provides a more detailed look at some of the more
advanced use cases of the <code>pacta.multi.loanbook</code> package for
PACTA for Supervisors analysis. First, we will touch on the technical
side of adjusting the analysis to your needs. Then, we will look at some
research questions that may occur in the field of banking supervision
with regard to climate transition risk and how the
<code>pacta.multi.loanbook</code> package can help answer them.</p>

<p>Any adjustment to the analysis that you may want to make and that is
supported by the <code>pacta.multi.loanbook</code> package can be done
by adjusting the <code>config.yml</code> file. For information on each
of the parameters and the values they accept, please refer to

<h3 id="use-case-identify-transition-risks-at-the-system-level">Use Case: Identify Transition Risks at the System Level<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-case-identify-transition-risks-at-the-system-level"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Supervisors need a systemic overview of
transition risks across the financial sector to understand
vulnerabilities that could affect financial stability.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> By analyzing different types of banks (e.g.,
systemically important banks, credit unions, specialized banks - lending
to specific sectors) or banks with public commitments (e.g., targets,
transition plans), supervisors can determine if transition risks are
concentrated within particular bank categories. For instance,
specialized banks focusing on fossil fuel sectors may face a higher
transition risk if these exposures are significant across the sector.
Identifying these patterns helps pinpoint specific areas of the
financial system that could destabilize the broader economy.</p>
<p>The <code>pacta.multi.loanbook</code> package can help supervisors
check if certain bank types show significant patterns of misalignment
and exposure that could warrant additional focus. For example, if we
know that certain specialized banks are focused on fossil fuel sectors,
we can check if these banks are more misaligned than others and if they
have a higher exposure to misaligned companies. This can be done by
comparing the net aggregate alignment metrics of different bank types
and also comparing this to the system-wide misalignment.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, suppose we want to run the analysis at
the aggregate system level as a reference and then determine how the
different bank types compare to this. We can obtain the required
results, by running the functions <code><a href="../reference/prioritise_and_diagnose.html">prioritise_and_diagnose()</a></code>
and <code><a href="../reference/analyse.html">analyse()</a></code> twice, with different parameter settings,
using the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to group the underlying loan books once by bank type and
once aggregated across all banks. The parameter for that is the
<code>by_group</code> parameter. The aggregate result can be obtained by
setting <code>by_group = "NULL"</code> (this always works) and the bank
type results can be obtained by setting
<code>by_group = "bank_type"</code> (this assumes that the raw and
matched loan books contain a variable called <code>bank_type</code> with
the relevant classification). The results can then be compared to see if
there are any significant differences in the net aggregate alignment
metrics between the different bank types and the aggregate system
level.</li>
<li>We also need to update the output directories for each of the runs
to ensure the results of one configuration are not overwritten with the
results of the other when rerunning the functions.
<ul>
<li>For <code><a href="../reference/prioritise_and_diagnose.html">prioritise_and_diagnose()</a></code>, we first set the output
to something like:
<code>dir_prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics: "path/to/prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_aggregate"</code>
and in the second run to
<code>dir_prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics: "path/to/prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_bank_type"</code>.</li>
<li>For <code><a href="../reference/analyse.html">analyse()</a></code>, we set the output to something like:
<code>dir_analysis: "path/to/analysis_aggregate"</code> and in the
second run to <code>dir_analysis: "path/to/analysis_bank_type"</code>.
We also need to make sure that when we run <code><a href="../reference/analyse.html">analyse()</a></code>, the
config.yml file points to the correct output directories for both the
<code>prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics</code> and
<code>analyse</code> functions, so the correct input files can be
accessed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After successfully running the functions for both sets of
parameters, we have results both at the aggregate system level and for
the different bank types, based on the exact same input loan books and
keeping all other model parameters constant. We can then compare the
results to see if there are any significant differences in the net
aggregate alignment metrics between the different bank types and the
aggregate system level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you have followed the naming convention described here, your
project folder should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>your_project_folder
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ input

â”œâ”€â”€ prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_bank_type
â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_aggregate
â””â”€â”€ analysis_bank_type</code></pre>
<p>Some important things to analyse when making such a comparison
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we have any groups (aggregate or bank type level) that have
significantly lower match success rates than other groups? If so, it may
be difficult to draw conclusions about that group and it may be a good
idea to review the options for increasing the match success rate. You
can use the charts in
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_*/plot_match_success_rate_rel_*.png</code>
to identify groups with low match success rates. Alternatively you can
use the file
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_*/lbk_match_success_rate_*.csv</code>
for the precise numbers.</li>
<li>What is the distribution of financial exposure between groups and
sectors? Are there any groups that have an especially high exposure to a
sector and that may therefore be candidates for concentration risk? E.g.
is there any group that is mostly exposed to only one sector? Is there
any sector whose exposure is mostly to one group? You can use the charts
in
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_*/plot_match_success_rate_abs_*.png</code>
to identify the financial exposures (matched and total) of each group to
each of the sectors. Alternatively you can use the file
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_*/lbk_match_success_rate_*.csv</code>
for the precise numbers.</li>
<li>After identifying potentially interesting groups, you can use the
charts in
<code>../analysis_*/plot_scatter_alignment_exposure_*.png</code> to see
the distribution of the net alignment metric by financial exposure for
each of the sectors and each group. This will help you identify if there
are any groups that are especially misaligned in a sector (y-axis) and
if this value corresponds to high financial exposure (x-axis). Things to
look out for are: any dot that is far away from the 0 intercept of the
y-axis indicates a strong deviation from the scenario. The values below
zero are groups that are misaligned. On the system level, any dot with a
high exposure and significant misalignment is a potential candidate for
further analysis.</li>
<li>Also, within each sector, any relatively high exposure group that is
misaligned may be of concern, as this could indicate concentration
risk.</li>
<li>For example, if specialized banks that focus on the fossil fuel
sector were heavily misaligned and dominate the lending to the fossil
fuel sector, any materializing risks from the fossil fuel industry would
hit these banks especially hard.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-case-assess-individual-financial-institutions-alignment-and-transition-risk">Use Case: Assess Individual Financial Institutionsâ€™ Alignment and
Transition Risk<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-case-assess-individual-financial-institutions-alignment-and-transition-risk"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the transition alignment of
individual institutions supports targeted oversight and informed
dialogue with entities facing significant transition exposures by
tailoring their engagement and expectations based on each institutionâ€™s
specific risk profile and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> Comparing institutions against benchmarks
(e.g., industry benchmarks -corporate economy-; financial benchmarks
-rest of banks-.) also highlights those needing improvement or with best
practices. This enables a more precise understanding of each
institutionâ€™s potential for transition risk and informs supervisory
assessments and actions.</p>
<p>The <code>pacta.multi.loanbook</code> package can help supervisors
assess individual financial institutionsâ€™ alignment and transition risk
by providing detailed insights into the exposure and alignment of each
institution. For example, supervisors can compare the net aggregate
alignment metrics by financial exposure split by each of the banks and
the sectors they operate in. This helps identify which banks have
material exposures that are especially misaligned. Once identified, the
standard PACTA for banks results can be used for a deep dive into the
source of the misalignment of the identified institutions. For some
sectors, this will be especially helpful, when PACTA can be used to
identify misalignment at the technology level. If any particularly
material sources of misalignment can be found for a bank, the supervisor
may want to consider using this insight as part of their supervisory
review and urge the bank to clarify if and how this exposure is
accounted for in their risk management.</p>
<p>The implementation of this use case is relatively
straight-forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>We simply need to run the full sequence of functions once, with the
results grouped at the bank level. Recall that each loan book is
automatically assigned a variable <code>"group_id"</code>, which can be
used here. We thus set <code>by_group: "group_id"</code> in the
<code>config.yml</code>.</li>
<li>We set output paths to something like:
<code>dir_analysis: "path/to/analysis_group_id"</code> and
<code>dir_prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics: "path/to/prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_group_id"</code>
to ensure that the results are not overwritten when rerunning the
functions, in case any other calculations have been made before.</li>
<li>After running the functions, we have detailed results for each of
the banks, which can be used to identify any material sources of
misalignment and transition risk. The results can be used to inform
supervisory assessments and actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you have followed the naming convention described here, your
project folder should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>your_project_folder
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ input
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ABCD.xlsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ loanbooks
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw_loanbook_1.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw_loanbook_2.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scenario_data_tms.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scenario_data_sda.csv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ prepared_abcd
â”œâ”€â”€ matched_loanbooks
â”œâ”€â”€ prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_group_id
â””â”€â”€ analysis_group_id</code></pre>
<p>Some steps in identifying financial institutions that may warrant a
deeper individual analysis are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the match success rates of the different banks. If any bank
has a significantly lower match success rate than others, it may be
difficult to draw conclusions about that bank and it may be a good idea
to review the options for increasing the match success rate. You can use
the charts in
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_group_id/plot_match_success_rate_rel_*.png</code>
to identify banks with low match success rates. Alternatively you can
use the file
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_group_id/lbk_match_success_rate_*.csv</code>
for the precise numbers.</li>
<li>Check the distribution of financial exposure between banks and
sectors. Are there any banks that have an especially high exposure to a
sector and that may therefore be candidates for concentration risk? E.g.
is there any bank that is mostly exposed to only one sector? Is there
any sector whose exposure is mostly to one bank? You can use the charts
in
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_group_id/plot_match_success_rate_abs_*.png</code>
to identify the financial exposures (matched and total) of each bank to
each of the sectors. Alternatively you can use the file
<code>../prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_group_id/lbk_match_success_rate_*.csv</code>
for the precise numbers.</li>
<li>After identifying potentially interesting banks, you can use the
charts in
<code>../analysis_group_id/aggregate/plot_scatter_alignment_exposure_*.png</code>
to see the distribution of the net alignment metric by financial
exposure for each of the sectors and each bank. This will help you
identify if there are any banks that are especially misaligned in a
sector (y-axis) and if this value corresponds to high financial exposure
(x-axis).</li>
<li>Once a bank has been identified that needs further inspection (very
positively aligned cases could also warrant additional analysis), you
can use the standard PACTA for banks results to identify the underlying
drivers of misalignment more clearly. This is especially important for
sectors, that have technology level pathways, as this will allow you to
identify if the misalignment is driven by the misalignment of any one of
the underlying technologies in particular, or if the misalignment comes
from all technologies across the board. To analyse this, you can use the
volume trajectory plots in
<code>../analysis_group_id/standard/&lt;bank name&gt;/plot_trajectory_&lt;sector&gt;_&lt;technology&gt;.png</code>
to see how far the projected pathway of production capacity deviates
from technology pathways. The further the line is in the red at time t5,
the higher the potential for this technology to drive misalignment.
However, you should also check the technology mix of the sector for the
identified bank, using the plots in
<code>../analysis_group_id/standard/&lt;bank name&gt;/plot_tech_mix_&lt;sector&gt;.png</code>.
You can check if the technologies that are strongly misaligned in t5
make up a relevant share of the portfolio technology mix. If for
example, you have a bank that is misaligned in the power sector and you
identify that both coal-fired power and gas-fired power seem to be far
off their scenario values in t5, you still need to check if these
technologies make up a relevant share of the power capacity financed by
this bank. If the tech mix shows that the majority of the underlying
power capacity for this bank is concentrated in gas-fired power, whereas
the share of coal-fired power is minimal, then the misalignment from
gas-fired power has a greater impact on the overall alginment of the
bank and is therefore more important for its risk profile.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-case-identify-hotspots-and-interlinkages-of-risk-exposure">Use Case: Identify Hotspots and Interlinkages of Risk Exposure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-case-identify-hotspots-and-interlinkages-of-risk-exposure"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Supervisors need to identify
concentrations of transition risks within certain sectors or
interlinkages across institutions to prevent risk contagion.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> Pinpointing sectors with heightened risk
exposures and identifying companies with high exposure across
institutions. This could be a proxy to identify concentrated risk
exposures.</p>
<p>The <code>pacta.multi.loanbook</code> package can help supervisors
identify hotspots and interlinkages of risk exposure by providing
detailed insights into the exposure and alignment of each institution.
For example, supervisors can compare the net aggregate alignment metrics
by financial exposure split by each of the sectors and the banks that
operate in them. This helps identify which sectors have material
exposures that are especially misaligned. Once identified, the company
level net aggregate alignment results can be used to analyze, if the
banks have similar exposures to misaligned sectors and companies.</p>
<p>This use case can use the same implementation as the previous one,
using results grouped by <code>"group_id"</code>. We can again identify
banks and sectors with high exposure and misalignment using the plot in
<code>../analysis_group_id/aggregate/plot_scatter_alignment_exposure_*.png</code>.
Any sectors that have multiple significantly misaligned banks are of
particular interest here. We now use the file
<code>../analysis_group_id/aggregate/company_exposure_net_aggregate_alignment_by_group_id.csv</code>.
We sort by <code>"alignment_metric"</code> and filter by the final year
of the analysis. This will show the companies with the highest
misalignment at the top, including the exposure each bank has to the
companies. Companies with strong misalignment and large exposures across
banks can be considered a particularly important source of potential
transition risk and the exposure across banks implies some contagion
risk.</p>

Misalignment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-case-identify-potential-reputation-risks-from-transition-misalignment"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Many banks have made public commitments
to align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement and signed up to
initiatives that proclaim this target. Not following up on such
commitments could lead to reputational risks for the banks, which should
be managed.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> Depending on the type of commitment made, it
may be relevant to check if future alignment is broadly aligned across
sectors for a bank, or alternatively, if the relevant sectors are
aligned with the bankâ€™s commitments. The caveat to this exercise is that
forward looking alignment does not capture past efforts the bank may
already have made to align its portfolio. However, it can be a useful
complementary tool to check if the bank is on track to meet its
commitments in the future.</p>
<p>The following steps should be followed to implement this use
case:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to group the underlying loan books once by
<code>group_id</code> (that is by bank) and once by
<code>net_zero_pledge</code>. The bank level result can be obtained by
setting <code>by_group = "group_id"</code> (this always works) and the
results by net zero pledge can be obtained by setting
<code>by_group = "net_zero_pledge"</code> (this assumes that the raw and
matched loan books contain a variable called
<code>net_zero_pledge</code> with the relevant classification).</li>
<li>We also need to update the output directories for each of the runs
to ensure the results of one configuration are not overwritten with the
results of the other when rerunning the functions.
<ul>
<li>For <code><a href="../reference/prioritise_and_diagnose.html">prioritise_and_diagnose()</a></code>, we first set the output
to something like:
<code>dir_prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics: "path/to/prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_group_id"</code>
and in the second run to
<code>dir_prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics: "path/to/prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_net_zero_pledge"</code>.</li>
<li>For <code><a href="../reference/analyse.html">analyse()</a></code>, we set the output to something like:
<code>dir_analysis: "path/to/analysis_group_id"</code> and in the second
run to <code>dir_analysis: "path/to/analysis_net_zero_pledge"</code>. We
also need to make sure that when we run <code><a href="../reference/analyse.html">analyse()</a></code>, the
config.yml file points to the correct output directories for both the
<code>prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics</code> and
<code>analyse</code> functions, so the correct input files can be
accessed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you have followed the naming convention described here, your
project folder should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>your_project_folder
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ input
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ABCD.xlsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ loanbooks
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw_loanbook_1.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw_loanbook_2.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scenario_data_tms.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scenario_data_sda.csv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ prepared_abcd
â”œâ”€â”€ matched_loanbooks
â”œâ”€â”€ prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_group_id
â”œâ”€â”€ prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics_net_zero_pledge
â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_group_id
â””â”€â”€ analysis_net_zero_pledge</code></pre>
<p>We can now check if:</p>
<ul>
<li>We see any significant differences in net alignment in any of the
PACTA sectors between banks that have made a net zero pledge and those
that have not. We inspect the charts in
<code>../analysis_net_zero_pledge/aggregate/plot_scatter_alignment_exposure_*.png</code>
to see the distribution of the net alignment metric by financial
exposure for each of the sectors and each group. This will help us
identify if there are any sectors that are especially misaligned for
banks that have made a net zero pledge.</li>
<li>If we see any patterns that warrant a deeper analysis, we can use
the bank level analysis to identify which banks seem to be the driver of
the difference in net alignment between banks that have made a net zero
pledge and those that have not. We will need to check in the raw data,
which banks have signed up, as the results for banks do not indicate
this information automatically, since you can only group results by one
variable at a time.</li>
<li>One way to circumvent this slighlty cumbersome process would be to
create a combined variable in the loan books, that includes information
on both the bank and the net zero pledge. This would allow getting the
required information in one run.</li>
<li>Any bank that we identify that has made a net zero pledge but is
strongly misaligned may be at risk of losing reputation and/or being
sued over noncompliance with its pledge. Of course, misalignment is
rarely ever a sufficient criterion to judge if reputational damage or
legal risk is likely to materialize. Other factors, such as progress
made in past efforts, implementation of transition plans, lending
strategy with regard to transition finance, etc. should be considered
too. But strong misalignment should be considered a warning signal, that
warrants further investigation into these other aspects and possibly a
dialogue with the affected bank.</li>
