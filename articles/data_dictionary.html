<p>In many cases, users of this package will want to use the outputs of
the analyses for further processing, such as additional analyses or
making visualizations based on the design guide of their own
organisation. To facilitate such additional use cases, but also simplify
interpretation of the outputs generated with this package, this data
dictionary documents each type of output table in detail, focusing on
data types and definitions.</p>
<p>This article is structured based on the output tables generated by
<code>workflow.multi.loanbook</code> and follows the standard flow of
the user experience as much as possible, so it can be read in the same
sequence as the analysis is run.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="tables">Tables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tables"></a>
</h2>
<p>The main steps that generate output tables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diagnostics and coverage</li>
<li>Standard PACTA analysis</li>
<li>Aggregated PACTA metrics</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="diagnostics">Diagnostics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#diagnostics"></a>
</h3>
<p>The diagnostics section is split into determining the match success
rate of the loan books analysed and inspecting the real economy activity
related to the financing made by the banks through the matched loan
books. The former is influenced by the quality of the input loan book
data and the completeness of the reference production data against which
the loan books are matched. The latter, while it depends on a solid
match success rate, is mainly driven by the financing decisions and the
portfolio allocation made by the banks.</p>
