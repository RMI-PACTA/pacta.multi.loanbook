\item{config}{either a path to a config.yml file or a list of parameters}

}
\description{
\code{match_loanbooks()} runs the necessary steps to match the raw input loan
books with the asset based company data (ABCD) used in the PACTA for
Supervisors analysis. Specifically, it prepares matched loan books based on
name matching or direct identifiers, depending on the configuration. The
output matched loan books need to be manually validated for further
processing. Parameters for the matching step are read from a \code{config.yml}
file and follow the options available in \code{r2dii.match::match_name}. The
function is called for its side effects and writes the prepared data sets to
the directory \code{output/match}, where \code{output} is the output directory
specified in the \code{config.yml}.
