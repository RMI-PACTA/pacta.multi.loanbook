\description{
\code{prioritise_and_diagnose()} runs the necessary steps to prioritise the matched
loan books and diagnose both the match success rate and the coverage of the
real economy assets by the matched loan books.
Parameters for all steps are read from a \code{config.yml} file. The function is
called for its side effects and writes the prepared and diagnosed data sets
to the directory \code{output/prioritise_and_diagnose}, where \code{output} is the
output directory  specified in the \code{config.yml}.

\code{prioritise_and_diagnose()} and \code{prioritize_and_diagnose()} are synonyms.
