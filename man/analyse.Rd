\usage{
analyse(config)

analyze(config)
}
\arguments{

\description{
\code{analyse()} runs the necessary steps to analyse the matched loan books,
producing both the outputs of the standard PACTA analysis and the outputs of
the net aggregated alignment metric, including tables and plots.
Parameters for all steps are read from a \code{config.yml} file. The function is
called for its side effects and writes the prepared and diagnosed data sets
to the directory \code{output/analysis}, where \code{output} is the
output directory  specified in the \code{config.yml}.

\code{analyse()} and \code{analyze()} are synonyms.
