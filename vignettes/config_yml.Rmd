# Intro

Most of the functions in this package require a path to a `config.yml` file as input. This structure allows for an easily reviewed file that contains all relevant parameters that should be / were used for a given multi-loanbook analysis. Below is a full documentation of each option.

# Preface

The config file is separated into a few top-level "sections" that contain contextually similar options. The top-level sections will be documented as well below, but note that the top-level sections themselves never have a value directly associated with them.

Also note that the config file must have the top-level section `default`. This is related to a feature of the `yaml` package which facilitates having and targeting different config sets for different purposes. Technically, one could leverage this for use with workflow.multi.loanbook, but it is not recommended.

# Options

## directories:

The `directories` section contains options to define locally accessible paths where input and output data should be found or saved. A full example `directories` section might look like:

    directories:
      dir_scenario: "~/Desktop/test/scenario"
      dir_abcd: "~/Desktop/test/abcd"
      dir_raw: "~/Desktop/test/raw"
      dir_matched: "~/Desktop/test/matched"
      dir_output: "~/Desktop/test/output"

#### dir_scenario

## file_names:
