# Overview

This cookbook provides a step-by-step guide to running the PACTA for Supervisors analysis using the `pacta.multi.loanbook` package. The analysis is designed to help financial supervisors assess the alignment of banks' loan books with the Paris Agreement goals.

## What is the PACTA for Supervisors analysis?

PACTA for Supervisors is based on the PACTA methodology, which assesses the alignment of financial portfolios with climate goals utilizing forward-looking asset-based company data (ABCD) that is linked to financial assets and compares the production profiles of those companies with technology and emissions pathways from climate transition scenarios at the sector and/or technology level.

## Who is this tool built for?

The PACTA for Supervisors analysis is primarily designed to be run by financial supervisors on their own, with minimal additional guidance. However, it can also be a useful tool for any other user, in case they would like to run a PACTA analysis on multiple loan books.

The main difference between this tool and the individual PACTA for Banks software packages is that this tool aims to facilitate the analysis of multiple loan books at once, streamlining the process as much as possible, to keep the burden for the user to a minimum. As such it is a helpful tool for anyone who would like to run a PACTA analysis on multiple loan books.

## What can the results of the PACTA for Supervisors analysis be used for?

Financial supervisors or regulators can use the results of the analysis to assess the alignment of banks' loan books with the Paris Agreement goals, to identify sectors where banks may need to take action to improve alignment, and to screen the financial system for potential climate-related transition risks. The analysis can be parameterised in different ways to explore patterns across the analysed loan books. If run by private institutions, the results may additionally be used to identify opportunities for climate-aligned investments, as well as for detecting individual counterparties that may be exposed to climate-related transition risks and may therefore require dedicated focus in the risk management process.

Users will be able to obtain both tabular outputs and plots that can be used for any of the above use cases. The tabular output further enables processing of the alignment results in other models or tools, for example as an input into financial risk models, or as a recurring input into internal monitoring systems.

The level of granularity of the outputs allows for a systematic analysis of climate alignment starting at the financial system level (across all analyzed loan books together), down to the individual counterparty level, and across sectors and technologies. Grouping of the results at any of these levels by additional dimensions can easily be achieved using the configuration file.

## What are the main steps of the analysis?

The main steps of the analysis are as follows:

1. Data preparation: Prepare the ABCD data and optionally a custom sector split.
2. Matching process: Match the raw loan books to the ABCD data.
3. Prioritization of loan books; Match success and coverage diagnostics: Prioritize the matched loan books and analyze their coverage.
4. Run PACTA for Supervisors analysis: Run the analysis based on the parameters set in the `config.yml` file.

This cookbook will guide you through each of the steps of the analysis in detail, explain the required input data sets and software, and provide guidance on how to interpret the results.

# Preparatory Steps

This section provides an overview of the preparatory steps that need to be taken before running the PACTA for Supervisors analysis. It includes information on the required input data sets, the required software, and the how to setup the project folder and file structure. Finally, it provides a checklist of the steps that need to be taken before running the analysis, summarizing in brief the steps explained in more detail before.

## Required Input Data Sets

The PACTA for Supervisors analysis requires a number of input data sets to run. Some of these can be obtained from external sources, while others need to be prepared by the user. Furthermore, some of the input data sets are optional and there inclusion will depend on the settings provided in the `config.yml` file. 

The main input data sets required for the analysis are the following:

### Asset-based Company Data (ABCD)

- required input
- external source
- XLSX file

This data set provides information on the production profiles and emission intensities of companies active in the following real economy sectors: Automotive (light-duty vehicles) manufacturing, aviation, cement production, coal mining, upstream oil & gas extraction, power generation, and steel production. The ABCD is typically obtained from third party data providers. However, it is possible to prepare the ABCD yourself or complement an external data set with entries that may not be covered out of the box.

The ABCD data set must be an XLSX file and contains the following columns:

```{r cols_abcd, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
# TODO: should this be in the data dictionary?
cat(paste0("- `", pacta.multi.loanbook:::cols_abcd, "`", collapse = "\n"))
```

Further information on how to obtain ABCD for PACTA and documentation of the individual sectors and data points can be found here **LINK**.

### Scenario Data

- required input(s)
- external source
- CSV file(s)

The scenario data set provides information on the trajectories of technologies/fuel types and of emission intensities pathways for each of (or a subset of) the sectors covered in PACTA.

For sectors with technology level trajectories, the data set provides the TMSR and SMSP pathways based on the Market Share Approach, an allocation rule that implies all companies active in a sector have to adjust their production in a way that keeps market shares constant and solves for the aggregate climate transition scenario (LINK to the market share documentation).

The target market share scenario data set must be a CSV file and contains the following columns:

```{r cols_tms_scenario, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
# TODO: should this be in the data dictionary?
cat(paste0("- `", names(pacta.multi.loanbook:::col_types_scenario_tms[["cols"]]), "`", collapse = "\n"))
```

For sectors that do not have technology level pathways, PACTA uses the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA), an allocation rule that implies that all companies in a sector have to converge their physical emission intensity at a future scenario value - e.g. in the year 2050. This implies that more polluting companies have to reduce their physical emissions intensity more drastically than companies using cleaner technology. It does not have any direct implications on the amount of units produced by any company (LINK to the SDA documentation).

The SDA scenario data set must be a CSV file and contains the following columns:

```{r cols_sda_scenario, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
# TODO: should this be in the data dictionary?
cat(paste0("- `", names(pacta.multi.loanbook:::col_types_scenario_sda[["cols"]]), "`", collapse = "\n"))
```

While the raw input values of the scenarios are based on external third party organisations - such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Joint Research Center of the European Commission (JRC), or the Institute for Sustainable Futures (ISF) - the input data set for PACTA must be prepared using additional steps, which are documented publicly on the following GitHub repositories:

- [pacta.scenario.data.preparation](https://github.com/RMI-PACTA/pacta.scenario.data.preparation)
- [workflow.scenario.preparation](https://github.com/RMI-PACTA/workflow.scenario.preparation)

Since RMI has taken over stewardship of PACTA the prepared scenario files can also be accessed as CSV downloads the [PACTA website](https://pacta.rmi.org/pacta-for-banks-2020/) under the "Methodology and Documents" tab of the "PACTA for Banks" section. The files are usually updated annually based on the latest scenario publications.

### Raw Loan Books

- required input
- self-prepared
- CSV file(s)

The raw loan books are the financial data sets that you would like to analyze. They contain information on the loans that banks have provided to companies. As a supervisor, the data required to construct these data sets will typically be available to you through regulatory filings that are accessed via internal data bases or similar. As a bank, the data required will be available in your internal systems.

The raw loan books must be prepared as CSV files and contain at a minimum the following columns:

```{r cols_raw_loanbooks, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
# TODO: should this be in the data dictionary?
cat(paste0("- `", names(pacta.multi.loanbook:::col_types_raw[["cols"]]), "`", collapse = "\n"))
```

**NOTE:** The tool will automatically add a column `group_id` to each of the loan books, which uses the file name as a value. This allows you to group the results the analysis by loan book, using the `by_group` parameter in the `config.yml` file. For any other variable that you may want to group the results by, you need to add a column to the raw loan book files that you then provide as the `by_group` parameter in the `config.yml` file.

For detailed descriptions of how to prepare raw loan books, see the [PACTA for Banks documentation](https://pacta.rmi.org/pacta-for-banks-2020/) and navigate to the "Training Materials" tab of the "PACTA for Banks" section. The *"User Guide 2"*, the *"Data Dictionary"*, and the *"Loan Book Template"* files can all be helpful in preparing your data.

**TODO:** check if the relevant documents are up to date

### Misclassified Loans

- optional input
- self-prepared
- CSV file

The user can provide a list of loans that have been misclassified in the raw loan books. The aim here is specifically to remove false positives, that is, loans that are classified in scope of one of the PACTA sectors, but where manual research shows that the companies do not actually operate within the PACTA scope. Such a false positive may be due to erroneous data entry in the raw loan book, for example. Removing these loans from the falsely indicated sector in the calculation of the match success rate will give a more accurate picture of what match success rate can really be reached.

### Asset-Based Company Data (ABCD) for company sector split

- optional input
- external source
- XLSX file

In case the user wants to split company exposures across sectors of in scope activity, the user must provide a version of the ABCD data set that follows the format of the Advanced Company Indicators data set by Asset Impact. This data set includes power generation values which are required for the primary energy based sector split.

### Companies to apply primary energy split on

- optional input
- self-prepared
- CSV file

When applying the sector split on company exposures, the user can provide a list of companies for which the sector split should be based on primary energy content. For all other companies, a simple equal weights split will be applied. For more information on the sector split, see the [documentation](https://github.com/RMI-PACTA/workflow.aggregate.loanbooks?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-calculate-sector-splits-for-multi-sector-companies).

**TODO:** Move the sector split documentation to this repo!

### Manual Sector Classification

- optional input
- self-prepared
- CSV file

**TODO:** Add once we have a stable implementation of this feature

## Required Software

Using the `pacta.multi.loanbook` package for the PACTA for Supervisors analysis requires the following software to be installed on your system:

### R (version 4.1.0 or higher)

R is the programming language that the `pacta.multi.loanbook` package is written in. You can download R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### RStudio (optional)

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R developed by Posit. It is not strictly required to run the analysis, but it can be helpful for managing your project and running the analysis. Generally, RStudio is very widely used among the R cummunity and probably the easiest way to interact with most R tools, such as `pacta.multi.loanbook`. RStudio Desktop is an open source tool and free of charge. You can download RStudio from the [Posit RStudio website](https://posit.co/downloads/).

### `pacta.multi.loanbook` R package

The `pacta.multi.loanbook` package is the main software tool that you will use to run the PACTA for Supervisors analysis. You can install the package from the [RStudio CRAN mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacta.multi.loanbook/index.html) by running the following command in R:

```{r install_package, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pacta.multi.loanbook")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version of the package from GitHub by running the following command in R:

```{r install_dev_package, eval = FALSE}
pak::pak("RMI-PACTA/pacta.multi.loanbook")
```

### Required R packages

The `pacta.multi.loanbook` package depends on a number of other R packages. These dependencies will be installed automatically when you install the `pacta.multi.loanbook` package. The required packages are:

```{r imports, echo = FALSE}
cat(utils::packageDescription("pacta.multi.loanbook")[["Imports"]])
```

### Suggested R packages

The suggested packages are not required to run the analysis, but they are used in the examples and vignettes provided with the package:

```{r suggests, echo = FALSE}
cat(utils::packageDescription("pacta.multi.loanbook")[["Suggests"]])
```

### FAQ

#### How do I install the `pacta.multi.loanbook` package?

The most common ways to install R packages are via CRAN or GitHub. Public institutions often have restrictions on the installation of packages from GitHub, so you may need to install the package from CRAN. In some cases, your institution may mirror CRAN in their internal application registry, so you may need to install the package from there. Should you have any issues with the installation from the internal application registry, it is best to reach out to your IT department. If you cannot obtain the package any of these ways, please reach out to the package maintainers directly for exploring other options.

#### How do I install the required R packages?

In principle, all dependencies required to run the `pacta.multi.loanbook` package will be installed automatically when you install the package. However, if you encounter any issues with the installation of the required packages, you can install them manually by running the following command in R, where ... should be replaced with the package names from the list above, separated by commas:

```{r install_deps, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c(...))
```

## Project Setup

### Config

All of the functions needed to run a PACTA for Supervisors analysis take a `config` argument, which can either be a path to a `config.yml` file (see `vignette("config_yml")`) or a config list object containing previously imported settings from a `config.yml` file. All of the settings/options are configured with this `config.yml` file.

### Input/Output folder structure

The `config.yml` file then points to an input and an output directory that the user can choose anywhere on their system, as long as R has read and write access to these directories. A recommendable choice to structure an analysis project would be to place both these folders and the `config.yml` file in a project folder. The input folder must contain all input files as described above, with the raw loan books being placed in a sub-directory that must be named `"loanbooks"`. The output folder can remain empty. It will be populated by running the analysis.

An example of how the project folder could be structured:

- project_folder
  - config.yml
  - input
    - loanbooks
      - raw_loanbook_1.csv
      - raw_loanbook_2.csv
      - ...
    - ABCD.xlsx
    - scenario_data_tms.csv
    - scenario_data_sda.csv
    - ...
  - output

# Running the Analysis

This section provides a step-by-step guide to running the PACTA for Supervisors analysis using the `pacta.multi.loanbook` package. It includes information on the structure of the workflow, the required functions, and the interpretation of the results.

## Structure of the Workflow

The PACTA for Supervisors analysis consists of four main steps:

- Data preparation: Preparing the input data sets for the requirements of the analysis.
- Matching process: Matching the raw loan books to the ABCD data and validating the matches manually.
- Prioritization of loan books: Selecting the correct matches for further analysis and diagnosing match success and coverage statistics
- Run PACTA for Supervisors analysis: Running the analysis based on the parameters set in the `config.yml` file to generate the production-based alignment analysis.

The following diagram illustrates the structure of the workflow:

![structure of the PACTA for Supervisors analysis](../man/figures/logo.png)

The following sub sections will provide detailed information on each of the steps of the analysis, starting with a brief explanation of the setup, as each of the functions will require the path to the `config.yml` file as an input argument.

### Setup

If you run PACTA for Supervisors interactively or from a script you may have prepared, you will likely want to load the `pacta.multi.loanbook` package and save the path to the `config.yml` file in a variable first:

```r
library(pacta.multi.loanbook)
config_path <- "config.yml"
```

This allows you passing the relevant config information easily to each of the four main functions.

### Data preparation

The first step of the analysis is to prepare your input data sets for the requirements of the analysis. Your ABCD data will need to be prepared and you can optionally use a custom sector split, that will also need to be prepared. The relevant function is `prepare_abcd()`, which takes configurations from the `config.yml` that you have prepared. The function will store intermediary files in a sub-directory, `prepare_abcd`, in your `output` folder. This step only has to be run once for an analysis. You can run this function as follows:

```r
pacta.multi.loanbook::prepare_abcd(config_path)
```

#### Options for the `prepare_abcd()` function

The `prepare_abcd()` function has a number of options that can be set in the `config.yml` file. These options include:

- whether or not inactive companies should be removed from the ABCD data (For more information on the options available, see the [relevant section on preparing the ABCD](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/config_yml.html#prepare_abcd) in the `vignette("config_yml")`.)
- if and how a company sector split should be applied in the calculations (For more information on the options available, see the [relevant section on the sector split](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/config_yml.html#sector_split) in the `vignette("config_yml")`). Additionally, see the [documentation of the sector split methodology](https://github.com/RMI-PACTA/workflow.aggregate.loanbooks?tab=readme-ov-file#methodological-note-sector-split-for-energy-companies).

<!--- TODO: move sector split documentation to this repository-->

### Matching process

The next step in the analysis is to run the matching process. Assuming you have prepared the raw loan books as explained in [the section on preparing the input data sets](### Raw Loan Books), you can now use the `match_loanbooks()` function. This will read the raw loan books from your inputs and attempt to match them to the prepared ABCD data from the previous step. The function will store matched loan book files in a sub-directory, `matched_loanbooks`, in your `output` folder. You can run this function as follows:

```r
pacta.multi.loanbook::match_loanbooks(config_path)
```

After the matching process is complete, you will need to do some manual matching. This means that you will need to manually inspect the suggested matches that the tool has found and decide which ones to keep or to remove. This is especially important when using text based matching, as there is no guarantee that similar company names as identified by the algorithms will actually refer to the same companies in the raw loan books and the ABCD. Thus, a manually validation step is crucial in the analysis, as the quality of the matches will determine the quality of the results of any further calculations.

The manual matching process is not automated and will require some time and effort on your part. You can find the matched loan books in the `output/matched_loanbooks` folder. The matched loan books will be stored in CSV files, one for each raw loan book. You can open these files in a spreadsheet program to verify the matches. Importantly, you will need to make a copy for each of the matched loan book files in the same `output/matched_loanbooks` folder and rename that copy by adding the suffix `_manual` to the file name. The following steps of the analysis expect this pattern, so it is important to follow this naming convention.

You can find more detaied information about the matching process in the training material on the [PACTA for Banks website](https://pacta.rmi.org/pacta-for-banks-2020/) in the section "PACTA for Banks Training Webinar 2" and in the [corresponding slide deck](https://pacta.rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PACTA-for-Banks-Training-Webinar-2-Matching-a-loan-book-to-physical-assets-in-the-real-economy-.pdf).

#### Some expectations for the matching process

- It is unlikely that you will be able to match all of the loans from your raw loan books to the ABCD data set. This is expected and has the following reasons:
  - Raw loan books often include companies that are not in scope of the PACTA analysis, for example there may be companies active in the financial sector or in manufacturing of IT products. Both these sectors are fully out of scope. There may also be companies that are active in upstream or downstream activities of the sectors covered by PACTA. This means that the company activities are not at the part of the value chain that is covered my PACTA and accordingly the companies are not matched. Examples for this are power distribution companies or companies that manufacture air crafts.
  - The ABCD data set may not cover all companies that are in scope of the PACTA analysis. While coverage of the real economy sectors is usually rather high in the data sets that are commonly used for PACTA, there are gaps. This implies that some in-scope companies cannot be matched because the ABCD data set does not include them. Advanced users may research the production profiles of such companies by themselves and add them to the ABCD data manually, however this is a very involved process and not standard procedure and will therefore not be covered in this cookbook.
  - If you are using sector classifications for the matching process (which is recommended whenever possible), some matches may not be identified in case the companies in the raw loan book are misclassified. For example, if a utility that is focused on coal-fired power generation is classified as a coal mining company, the matching function will not suggest a match.
- Given that it is unlikely to match all loans, it is recommended to try and match the companies with the largest financial exposures first, as this ensures the best possible financial coverage of the loan book in the analysis.
- It is also recommended to run multiple iterations of the matching process, potentially adjusting the matching parameters in the `config.yml` file, to see if you can improve the match success rate. The match success rate can be obtained based on the manually validated matched loan books and the raw loan books as described in [the next section on prioritization and diagnostics](### Prioritization of loan books; Match success and coverage diagnostics).

#### Options for the `match_loanbooks()` function

The `match_loanbooks()` function has a number of options that can be set in the `config.yml` file. These options include:

- specifications for the approach to matching the raw loan book with the ABCD [relevant section on matching](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/config_yml.html#matching) in the `vignette("config_yml")`). Note that these parameters are all based on the `r2dii.match::match_name` function and pass the parameters directly to that function. For more information on the options available, see the [documentation of the r2dii.match package](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.match/reference/match_name.html). This also covers matching based on unique identifiers, which is the most reliable way to match companies, but requires that both the raw loan books and the ABCD contain such identifiers.
- whether to use a manually prepared sector classification system for matching the loan books to in-scope PACTA sectors, see the [relevant section on matching](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/config_yml.html#matching) in the `vignette("config_yml")`), or not. If not, the sector classification systems provided in `r2dii.data::sector_classifications` can be used.
 
#### Addressing misclassfied loans

There are two ways to appropriately handle misclassified loans that are identified as in-scope in the raw data set but are then not matched.

1. Correct the classification in the raw loan book and re-run the matching process. If the loan was clearly mis-classified, this may be the most appropriate way to handle the issue. It may be a good idea to record any such changes made in the input data though. The upsdie of this approach is that the loan will now either be matched correctly, as it will be assigned the sector that the company should have and therefore find an entry in the ABCD data set to match against. Or, if there is still no match to be found in the ABCD, the loan will correctly be missing in the appropriate sector and therefore indicate a lower match success rate where it should.
2. If a manual re-classification of the raw loan book is not possible or desired, the calculation of the match success rate can be corrected by adding a file `loans_to_remove.csv` to the input directory. This file should include the columns `id_loan` and `group_id` to indicate the precise mis-classified loan and the loan book in which it was found. This combnation of loan and loan book will then be excluded from the match success calculation.

The reason why it is a good idea to either correct mis-classified loans or disregard them in the calculation of the match success rate is that a mis-classified loan cannot possibly be matched in a given sector. Therefore, no amount of work would be sufficient to improve the sector match success rate, because it is calculated against an incorrect baseline. Technically, the user is not forced to correct misclassifications, and there may be a limit to how much time should be spent on this, but it is recommended to at least correct large mis-classified loans.

### Prioritization of loan books; Match success and coverage diagnostics

The next step is to prioritize the manually verified matched loan books and analyze their coverage, both relative to the raw loan book inputs (the "match success rate") and to the production capacity in the wider economy (the "loan book production coverage"). Prioritizing the loan books means that you will only keep the best identified match for each loan and use that in the following steps of the analysis.

You will probably want to check the status of your loan book and production coverage several times, as it is rare to get to the desired level of matching in one iteration. This means you may want to repeat the previous step (matching the loan books, likely using different parameters for different iterations) and this step (prioritizing the matched loan books and analyzing their match success rate) a number of times to reach the best possible outcome. To prioritize your matched loan books and calculate display the coverage diagnostics, you will use the `prioritise_and_diagnose()` function. This call will store matched prioritized loan book files and coverage diagnostics in a sub-directory, `prioritized_loanbooks_and_diagnostics`, in your `output` folder. You can then run the function as follows:

```r
pacta.multi.loanbook::prioritise_and_diagnose(config_path)
```

#### Options for the `prioritise_and_diagnose()` function

The `prioritise_and_diagnose()` function has a number of options that can be set in the `config.yml` file. These options include:

- the option to set a specific order for prioritizing the matches. This is an option that is passed directly to the `r2dii.match::prioritize` function. `NULL` is a valid default value and is usually a setting that works well, at least as a starting point. For more information, see the [relevant section on the prioritization of matched loan books](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/config_yml.html#match_prioritize) in the `vignette("config_yml")` or the [documentation of the r2dii.match::prioritize() function here](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.match/reference/prioritize.html).


### Run PACTA for Supervisors analysis

The final step is running the analysis based on the parameters you have set in the `config.yml` file. This entails both a standard PACTA for Banks analysis and the calculation of the net aggregate alignment metric. For both parts of the analysis, outputs will be stored in the sub-directories `analysis/standard` (for standard PACTA for Banks results) and `analysis/aggregated/` for the net aggregate alignment metric in your `output` folder and comprise tabular outputs and plots. To run the analysis on all of your previously matched and prioritized loan books, you will use the `analyse()` function as follows:

```r
pacta.multi.loanbook::analyse(config_path)
```

#### Options for the `analysis()` function and the overall analysis

The `analysis()` function has a number of options that can be set in the `config.yml` file. These options include:

- which source should be used for allocating climate transition scenario pathways to the companies and loan books. This refers to the relevant scenario publication and usually contains the name and the year of the publication, e.g.: `"weo_2023"` or `"geco_2023"`.
- which scenario should be used for reference in the net aggregate alignment metric. This must be a scenario that is included in the source indicated above.
- which region to use as a reference for the analysis. This will filter the underlying production capacity to assets in the relevant region and will measure alignment against the scenario trajectory for the relevant region. It must therefore be a region, for which scenario data is available in the source selected above.
- the start year of the analysis. This must be a year that is available both in the ABCD data and for which the scenario data has been prepared. The loan book data is assumed to be a snapshot of the end of the same year.
- the time frame of the analysis, which refers to the number of forward looking years after the start year that are to be considered in the alignment analysis. Usually this time frame is set to 5 years. Specifically, it must be a time frame for which scenario data values and ABCD data values are available for all sectors that are to be analyzed. There are not many cases, in which it is expected to change the time frame to something else than its default value of 5 years.
- by which variables to group the loan books to produce grouped results of the analysis. This parameter is used across multiple steps of the analysis, both in the diagnostics and in the analysis. This is because it slices and/or aggregates the loan books such that the analysis will produce results along the indicated dimension. If no `by_group` parameter is passed (i.e. `NULL`), all loan books will be aggregated. Otherwise, loan books can either be kept separate (`group_id`) or grouped by any other variable that is provided in each of the raw loan books.
<!---TODO: maybe some of the project_parameters should be in the config section analysis, if thei are not used in other parts of the workflow--->

All these options are documented in more detail the [section on project parameters](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/pacta.multi.loanbook/articles/config_yml.html#project_parameters) in the `vignette("config_yml")`.

Usually, it will be interesting to run the analysis for more than one by_group, possibly also for multiple combinations of the other parameters. You will therefore have to run the analysis as many times as there are combinations of interest that you wish to generate results for.
